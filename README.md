#### TTPs and IOCs (attack methods and traces they leave)

TTP = Tactics, Techniques and Procecdures
IOC = Indicator of Compromise

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts or patterns that may signal a security incident or a cyberattack. While traditional IOCs often include specific signatures or known threat indicators, organizations are increasingly focusing on detecting abnormal behaviors and anomalies as a proactive approach to cybersecurity. Here are some examples of IOCs that involve looking for abnormal behavior:

1. **URL**:
    
    - Abnormal URL access patterns or unexpected access to suspicious or known malicious domains.
2. **New File**:
    
    - Detection of an unusually large number of new or modified files within a short timeframe, which may indicate a malware infection or unauthorized data transfer.
3. **Execution**:
    
    - Monitoring for unusual or unauthorized code execution activities, such as running scripts, binaries, or PowerShell commands.
4. **Process**:
    
    - Identifying suspicious or anomalous process behavior, such as processes attempting to execute unauthorized actions or accessing sensitive areas of the system.
5. **RAT (Remote Access Trojan)**:
    
    - Detecting the presence of a RAT or other unauthorized remote access tools on the network or within systems.
6. **File Hash**:
    
    - Comparing file hashes to known good and known malicious hashes to detect changes or anomalies in file integrity.
7. **Registry**:
    
    - Monitoring for unusual registry changes, such as the creation of new keys or modifications to existing keys that may indicate unauthorized system changes.
8. **Resources**:
    
    - Tracking resource utilization, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, to detect unusual spikes or patterns that may be indicative of a security incident.
9. **New Apps**:
    
    - Identifying the installation of new applications or software, especially those not approved or authorized by the organization.
10. **Protocols**:
    
    - Analyzing network traffic to detect unusual or unauthorized protocol usage, potentially signaling malicious or non-standard network activities.
11. **New Device**:
    
    - Monitoring for the addition of new devices or endpoints to the network, especially if these devices are unauthorized or unrecognized.
12. **Exfiltration**:
    
    - Identifying data exfiltration attempts, such as unusual or large data transfers to external sources, which could be indicative of data theft.


#### IoCs: Shift in Perspective
The shift in perspective regarding Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) involves transitioning from a traditional, signature-based approach to a more dynamic and behavior-based approach. This shift is largely driven by the evolving threat landscape, which includes sophisticated and rapidly changing cyber threats. Here's how different elements play a role in this shift:

1. **Automated HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems) and HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems)**:
    
    - **Traditional Perspective**: In the past, HIPS and HIDS systems primarily relied on known attack signatures or patterns to detect threats. They would look for specific strings, file hashes, or known malicious behavior to trigger alerts or block actions.
        
    - **Shift in Perspective**: The shift involves incorporating behavior-based analysis in HIPS and HIDS systems. Rather than solely relying on signatures, these systems now actively monitor the behavior of applications and processes on a host. Anomalous behaviors or deviations from established baselines can trigger alerts or block actions, even if a specific signature is not known. This approach is better suited to detecting novel or previously unseen threats.
        
2. **Correlation in SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**:
    
    - **Traditional Perspective**: Traditional SIEM systems primarily focused on collecting and correlating security event logs and known attack signatures to identify and respond to security incidents.
        
    - **Shift in Perspective**: The shift involves enhancing SIEM capabilities with advanced analytics and machine learning. SIEM solutions now focus on identifying abnormal patterns of behavior, both within a single system and across the network. This enables the detection of sophisticated threats that may not leave easily recognizable traces in log data.
        
    - **Benefits**: The shift toward behavior-based IoC detection in SIEM solutions allows for more proactive and context-aware threat detection. These systems can identify complex attack scenarios and respond more effectively to emerging threats.

    - **Definition**: SDOs are specific objects defined within the STIX framework to represent different aspects of threat intelligence. These objects include entities like indicators, threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, and more.
        
    - **Use in Threat Modeling**: SDOs enable organizations to model and represent various elements related to security threats. For example, SDOs can be used to define threat indicators (IoCs), attack signatures, threat actor profiles, and other threat-related information. This helps organizations structure and organize threat data for more effective threat modeling and analysis.



*TAXII Protocol*
TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information) is an open standard protocol used for sharing cyber threat intelligence, specifically indicators of compromise (IoCs), among different organizations and security stakeholders. It enables the structured and automated exchange of threat information in a standardized format, facilitating the sharing of critical data to enhance collective cybersecurity efforts. TAXII is often used in conjunction with STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression), which defines how threat information is structured.

Here's a brief overview of the TAXII protocol:

- **Protocol Purpose**: TAXII enables organizations to share threat intelligence, such as IoCs (e.g., IP addresses, file hashes, URLs) and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) with trusted partners, government agencies, industry-specific information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs), and other security stakeholders.
    
- **Standardization**: TAXII standardizes the way threat intelligence is exchanged, ensuring that data is structured, consistent, and interoperable across different organizations and systems.
    
- **Information Sharing**: Organizations use TAXII to share threat intelligence information, such as indicators of compromise, vulnerabilities, and threat actor profiles. This information helps participants better understand and respond to emerging threats.
    
- **Transport Mechanisms**: TAXII supports multiple transport mechanisms, including HTTPS, email, and message queuing, allowing organizations to choose the method that suits their specific requirements.
    
- **Profiles**: TAXII defines different profiles that organizations can use to tailor the exchange of threat intelligence to their specific needs, whether that involves sharing with specific trusted partners or within specific sectors or regions.
    
- **Security and Access Control**: Security and access controls are important aspects of TAXII. It ensures that threat data is only shared with authorized parties and that sensitive information is protected.
    
- **Example**: Let's say two financial institutions want to share information about a recent phishing campaign targeting the banking sector. Using TAXII, they can exchange information about specific phishing URLs, email subjects, and other indicators involved in the campaign. This enables both organizations to bolster their defenses and take appropriate measures to mitigate the threat.



#### Other Threat Data Feeds (Other threat intelligence sources)

**AIS (Automatic Indicator Sharing)**: AIS systems allow organizations and government agencies to automatically share cyber threat indicators, such as IoCs (Indicators of Compromise), with trusted partners and peers. This information sharing promotes collective defense against cyber threats.

    **Example (Linux - using ip):**
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `ip address show`
    
2. **ping:**
    
    - Tests reachability of a host on a network and measures the round-trip time for messages to travel from the source to the destination.
    
    **Example:**
    
    
    `ping www.example.com`
    
3. **arp:**
    
    - Displays and modifies the IP-to-Physical address translation tables used by the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
    
    **Example:**
    
    
    `arp -a`
    
4. **route:**
    
    - Displays and manipulates the IP routing table.
    
    **Example:**
    
    
    `route print`
    
5. **traceroute / trace / tracert:**
    
    - Traces the route that packets take to reach a destination, showing the IP addresses of the routers along the way.
    
    **Example (Windows - tracert):**
    
    
    `tracert www.example.com`
    
    **Example (Linux - traceroute):**
    
    
    `traceroute www.example.com`

    **Example:**
    
    
    `pathping www.example.com`
    
7. **mtr:**
    
    - Combines the functionality of ping and traceroute in a single tool, providing continuous updates on both round-trip time and route changes.
    
    **Example:**
    
    
    `mtr www.example.com`
    

These commands are invaluable for diagnosing network issues, understanding the network configuration, and optimizing network performance. Note that the availability and syntax of these commands may vary slightly between different operating systems.

### NMAP (Network mapper)

1. **Network Discovery:**
    
    - **Objective:** Identify live hosts on the network and discover which IP addresses are in use.
    - **Nmap Command Example:**
        
        
        `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`
        
        This command performs a ping scan (`-sn`), which checks the reachability of hosts without scanning the actual ports. Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your target network.
2. **Service Discovery:**
    
    - **Objective:** Identify open ports, services, and their versions on the live hosts discovered in the network.
    - **Nmap Command Example:**
        
        
        `nmap -p 1-1000 -sV 192.168.1.1`
        
        This command scans ports 1 to 1000 (`-p 1-1000`) on the host with IP address 192.168.1.1 and attempts to determine the service versions (`-sV`).

These are simplified examples, and Nmap offers a wide range of options and features for more detailed and customized scans. Here's a breakdown of the commands:

- The `-sn` option in the first command stands for "no port scan" or "ping scan," which is used for host discovery.
- The `-p` option in the second command specifies the range of ports to be scanned, and `-sV` instructs Nmap to attempt to determine service versions.
